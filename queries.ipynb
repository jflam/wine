      "NAME: Girl Go Lightly Girl Go Lightly 2012 Moscato (California) (US)\n",

      "NAME: Clos Solène Clos Solène 2010 Sweet Clémentine Grenache (Paso Robles) (US)\n",
      "REVIEW: Sweet with raspberry jam, cherry liqueur and vanilla cream flavors, this is a good dessert wine. But it could be a lot better if it were more intense. The finish trails off a little.\n",
      "RANK: 86 DISTANCE: 0.34\n",
      "NAME: Forest Glen Forest Glen 2009 White Merlot (California) (US)\n",
      "REVIEW: As sweet as a dessert wine, with sugary raspberry, cherry and spice flavors.\n",

      "NAME: Château Suau Château Suau 2009 500 ml  (Cadillac) (France)\n",
      "REVIEW: Billed as a dessert wine, this is in fact more of an apéritif wine, with its botrytis sweetness muted by a soft, open character. It has ripe apricot flavors, hints of honey and a tang of orange peel.\n",
      "RANK: 85 DISTANCE: 0.37\n",
      "NAME: Di Majo Norante Di Majo Norante 2006 Apianae Moscato (Molise) (Italy)\n",
      "REVIEW: This is an extraordinary, golden dessert wine with intense and penetrating notes of honey, marron glacé, dried apricot, marzipan, candied lemon, dried mint and jasmine. It's smooth, rich and long lasting in the mouth. The wine has personality and power and boasts magnetic appeal across the board.\n",

      "NAME: Rare Rare NV 4 Grape Blend White (California) (US)\n",
      "REVIEW: This seems so sweet, you could almost classify it as a dessert wine. It has simple orange, pineapple and vanilla flavors.\n",
      "RANK: 82 DISTANCE: 0.37\n",
      "NAME: Bogle Bogle 2010 Riesling (California) (US)\n",
      "REVIEW: You almost have to classify this Riesling as a dessert wine, because it crosses the line from off-dry into frankly sweet. It's an easy sipper, with honeyed tangerine and pear flavors. Could be a little brighter in acidity, though.\n",

      "NAME: Bouchaine Bouchaine 2012 Bouche d'Or Chardonnay (Carneros) (US)\n",

      "NAME: Binyamina Binyamina 2010 Late Harvest Cluster Select Reserve Gewürztraminer (Galilee) (Israel)\n",
      "REVIEW: This late-harvest dessert wine is sweet and unctuous, with ripe aromas and flavors of peaches and nectarines drizzled with honey and dusted with sweet baking spice. The mouthfeel is thick and full, but lifted with enough acidity to keep it from feeling cloying on the close.\n",
      "RANK: 89 DISTANCE: 0.40\n",
      "NAME: Castello del Poggio Castello del Poggio NV Moscato (Asti) (Italy)\n",
      "REVIEW: A delightful dessert wine, it carries a fruity fragrance of peach and tropical fruit. The frothy palate shows sweet peach and green melon accented with hints of sage. It finishes on a refreshing note. Pair this with sorbet or fruit tarts.\n",

      "NAME: Novy Novy 2006 Oley Dessert Wine Viognier (Russian River Valley) (US)\n",

      "REVIEW: This is a ripe, sweet and immediately attractive dessert wine, with forward aromas and flavors of dried apricot, golden raisin, papaya, honeycomb and gingered orange. Hints of sweet spice and toasted nuts unfold on the long close. It's viscous and lush, but with ample acidity to lift the finish. Drink now–2018.\n",
      "RANK: 92 DISTANCE: 0.41\n",
      "NAME: Mattina Fiore Mattina Fiore 2013 Fiorellino Murmur Vineyard Late Harvest Viognier (Santa Maria Valley) (US)\n",
      "REVIEW: This is a complex and lively dessert wine, with concentrated quince and honeysuckle on the nose, as well as tangerine skin and the slightest touch of white rock minerality. It's soft on the palate, with a bitter grapefruit-pith twist, showing flavors of golden honey, lemon balm, chamomile and chive.\n",

      "NAME: Jana Jana 2007 Old Vine Riesling (Napa Valley) (US)\n",
      "REVIEW: You could classify this as an off-dry wine, but it's just sweet and honeyed enough to be a dessert wine. With pleasant acidity providing balance, it shows flavors of ripe peaches, diesel, nectarines, apples, vanilla and buttercup flowers.\n",
      "RANK: 85 DISTANCE: 0.41\n",
      "NAME: Chacewater Chacewater 2000 15 Year Old Tawny Dessert Wine Red (Lake County) (US)\n",
      "REVIEW: A delicious, beautifully aged tawny-style dessert wine, this rarity is sweet and fortified with alcohol, and also superbly well balanced. A diverse palette of flavors includes toffee, coffee, sweet prune, toasted almonds and chocolate. Supportive tannins and acidity keep the texture lively and the finish lingering.\n",
      "RANK: 94 DISTANCE: 0.41\n",
      "NAME: Robert Mondavi Robert Mondavi 2012 Moscato d'Oro Moscato (Napa Valley) (US)\n",
